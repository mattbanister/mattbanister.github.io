I decided to start experimenting with blogging using a static site generator.  I'm using the excellent [zola](https://www.getzola.org) (formerly gutenberg) static site generator. It's very fast and well thought out and makes putting a nice looking site together very easy.  I'll fill this post out with the steps I took to put this site together shortly.

Here is an example code block

```rust

fn sum(vals: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    vals.iter().fold(0, |acc, el| acc + el)
}

```
